You'll need the Console Commands mod to change portraits.

* To change your character's portrait, copy the following code and paste it into the console:
(replace the 'fpp_ai_fi.png' with the filename of the portrait you want)

runcode Global.getSector().getPlayerPerson().setPortraitSprite("graphics/portraits/fpp_ai_f1.png");



* To change your officers' portraits, copy the following code and paste it into the console:
(same goes for replacing the filename.)
(Replace '0' at the end of the second line with the number of the officer you want to change. 0 is the first in the list, 1 is the second, etc.)

runcode import com.fs.starfarer.api.characters.OfficerDataAPI;
OfficerDataAPI officer =  (OfficerDataAPI)Global.getSector().getPlayerFleet().getFleetData().getOfficersCopy().get(0);
officer.getPerson().setPortraitSprite("graphics/portraits/fpp_ai_f1.png");
