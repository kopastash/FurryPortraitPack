I have permission from the original art owners to make this specific portrait pack. I don't have permission for anything else.

All art in this mod is owned by individual members of the Starsector community.  
(Except for the stuff that was AI-generated, which is free-use.)

Credit for specific portraits is anonymous unless otherwise requested, or if the art wasn't provided privately.
- AI Generated using thisfursonadoesnotexist.com: fpp_ai_*.png
- Admiral Kresta: fpp_real_m7
- Lennoxicon: fpp_real_TT_m1, fpp_real_LC_m1 (and two others that you can probably tell by art style)

Do you have art you want in here? Message @theDragn on the unoffical discord, or @theDragn on telegram.
You *must* have full permission to distribute and modify the art for me to put it in here. 
This generally means you need to have made it yourself, purchased it, or commissioned it.
It also, obviously, must be SFW, or at least cropped to be unarguably SFW.
